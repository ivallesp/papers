This paper contains one of the biggest surveys of currently available clustering algorithms. It is a good reference to have a broad picture and choose the appropiate algorithm for an application.

The most important information is summarized in a set of tables. They have been compiled and sticked below. Proper high level descriptions of each of the algorithms are included in the paper.
